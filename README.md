## Description
This project is an update on the film query project and utilizes many of its methods and logic. However, this application incorporates the front end as well, allowing the user to Look up Film's by ID 1-1000, Search for a Film by a Keyword, create a new film. however, rather than this being carried out within the console, it is done on a web page with HTML forms. Once a film or list of films have been displayed the user then has the option to update or delete any film in particular. These changes are to be carried out to the database and should not be done lightly as they are committed in the method calls.

## Lessons Learned
This Project emphasized in particular the utility and convenience of .jsp's in terms of creating servlets to communicate with the database. Within said .jsp's we utilized Expression Language, which while convenient logically in terms of implicitly locating and implementing methods like setters and getter, it also offered challenges syntactically and in terms of understanding the flow of communication between separate classes. However, this project forced the two of us to better understand EL. SpringMVCFilmCRUD was also our very first pair programming project and emphasized the importance of being able to seek aid from a partner when clarification is needed on any issue. And where clarification couldn't be offered we were able to reason through the project together.
